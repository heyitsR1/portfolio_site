# My Personal Portfolio Site

This is a personal portfolio website showcasing my projects and providing information about myself.

## About Me

Hi, I'm Aarohan, a CS undergraduate student from Nepal. My primary interests lie in Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), Cloud Computing, and Data Science.

## About This Website

As someone who isn't primarily a front-end developer, this website is built using basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It serves as a unique and personal space for me to display my projects and share a bit about who I am. The code for this site is publicly available as I believe it might be of interest to others.

This is the Figma design I started the project with:
